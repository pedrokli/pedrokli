- 👋 Hello, I’m Pedro — a developer transitioning into AWS Cloud Architecture, with a background in Systems Analysis and Development from FIAP.

- 👨‍🎓 Currently specializing in AWS through certified courses, focusing on:
    - Designing scalable and secure cloud solutions
    - Hands-on experience with EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SQS, SNS
    - Event-driven architectures using Java, Spring Boot, and AWS services
      
- 🌱 Goal:
  To work as a Cloud Architect or AWS Solutions Engineer, designing and implementing robust, end-to-end cloud solutions

- 🧠 Development Principles:
  - Build with purpose: I focus on scalable, maintainable solutions that deliver real business value.
  - Execution over perfection: I believe in iterative development, feedback loops, and shipping to learn.
  - Open Source by default: I actively learn from and contribute to the community, believing collaborative knowledge drives better engineering.
  - Always a student: The cloud landscape evolves daily; continuous learning isn't an option, it's the core of the craft.
    
- 🖥 Current tech stack:
  AWS, Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Git, Linux, SQL, NoSQL, Event-Driven Architecture, IaC (learning Terraform/CloudFormation)
    

My previous experience with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and data collection has given me a strong foundation in system integration and data activation, which I now apply in a cloud-native context.
